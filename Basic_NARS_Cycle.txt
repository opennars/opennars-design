Basic NARS Cycle
------------------

parse input tasks 

for each term in task term tree (upto depth 3)
	add task to concept(term) - creating concept if necessary

loop
	activeconcept = select concept
	select tasklink from active concept
	process selected task in activeconcept - including execting operations
	select belief from tasklink target

	do inference on (task, belief)

	for each task in inference results
		for each term in task term tree (upto depth 3)
			add task to concept(term)
			update links used based on inference results



tasks, links, beliefs and concepts are removed, based on budget value, when containers reach capacity
